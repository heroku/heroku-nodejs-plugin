# We've moved!

Hello. This repository is no longer in use and has been archived for historical purposes.

The native addon for Node.js metrics collection that was previously here has been replaced with a plugin
that uses performance APIs built directly into Node.js. This [new plugin](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/blob/main/metrics/metrics_collector.cjs)
is now bundled with the [heroku/nodejs](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs) buildpack.
